1. make a "randomize" selection to supplement chronological/alphabetical/uploadtime radio buttons.
2. add a better upload tool, something with a progress bar.

Pictures.php - manipulate the image for homepage-display -- home page pics -- ratio: 4 x 3, specifically: 800 x 600

config.php -- add ability to change colors of borders/background/font/etc on picture pages

image_display.php --
figure out a better way to display full-image ... maybe iframes? (nice border, still see background if image is narrow/wide)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18545077/image-fullscreen-on-click/50430187
use <img data-enlargeable> to have the image go fullscreen when clicked.

header.php --  move JS initializations to the end of the document so the pages load faster (not sure if they work if at the end? got junit errors til i moved them back here...)

php.ini -- allow larger sizes because videos are so much bigger 

pictures.js --
theres gotta be a way to use javascript to check each file and removing existing ones from the form??
not sure how that would be executed
ajax call, followed by form submission (with appropriate retractions)
and don't forget to move the warnings of files that were not uploaded so they still display
